# inverted-maze
### A childhood invention, made into a real digital maze in Javascript. Isn't it aMAZEing?

In this maze, the unmarked lines on graph paper direct you forward instead of the traditional walls of a maze. This maze requires a different approach, which you will discover when you open the tutorial. The tutorial is also openable by querystring: open the link with <code>#&tutorial=true</code> appended at the end.

This repo was coded in vanilla javascript. As my programming knowledge has evolved, I have made use of various frameworks for my coding projects. A future version coded in some other framework may someday be forthcoming.
